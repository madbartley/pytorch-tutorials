# pytorch-tutorials
A collection of each of the introductory PyTorch tutorials on the official documentation page with my own code and notes added.

The files in this repository are based on the tutorials found here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html

One of my favorite ways to learn a new programming tool is to go through the documentation and complete all of the beginning tutorials, breaking down each piece step-by-step with my own notes and examples. This way, I have a quick, easy reference that is written in my own words, and it allows me to work out some of the more challenging areas before I need to use them in my own projects. 

When I decided I wanted to teach myself how to write machine learning programs, I started with PyTorch, one of the most popular open-source ML/AI frameworks currently available. Not only can you run each tutorial using these files, but you can view the notes and examples that I wrote to help me gain a better understanding of how to use PyTorch.

I had a blast learning PyTorch, and I'm excited to use it in future ML projects!
